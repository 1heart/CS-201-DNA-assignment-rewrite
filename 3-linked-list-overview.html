    LinkStrand Class Overview
    <p>
        You’ll be creating a class LinkStrand that implements a Java interface IDnaStrand. The class simulates cutting a strand of DNA with a restriction enzyme and appending/splicing-in a new strand.
	</p>
	
	<p>
        You must use a linked-list to support the operations — specifically the class LinkStrand should maintain pointers to a linked list used to represent a DNA strand. You should maintain a pointer to the first Node of the linked list and to the last Node of the linked list. These pointers are maintained as class invariants – the property of pointing to   first/last nodes must hold after any method in the class executes (and thus before any  method in the class executes). A Strand of DNA is initially represented by a linked list   with one Node; the Node stores one string representing the entire strand of DNA. Thus  initially the instance variables myFirst and myLast will point to the same node. If any nodes are appended,	the	value of myLast must be	updated	to ensure that it correctly	points to the last node	of the new list.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      	You’ll need a nested/inner class to represent a Node of	
      	the	linked list	for	storing	DNA	information. Here is what that should look like:

        The diagram below shows the results of cutting an original strand of DNA at three points and then splicing-in the strand “GTGATAATTC” at each of the locations at which the original strand was cut. Since splicing into a linked list is a constant-time, O(1) operation this implementation should be more efficient in time and space when compared to the String implementation.
